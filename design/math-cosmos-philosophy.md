# Mathematical Resonance

Mathematical Resonance treats space as a field of inference: every line behaves like a theorem under pressure, every curve like a proof in motion. Composition is deliberately asymmetrical, but balanced through force lines that pull the eye between local detail and global order.

Color is constrained to deep spectral blues with controlled cyan and amber sparks. This palette signals rigor first, wonder second. Bright accents are used sparingly, only where the composition needs a focal argument, so the image feels disciplined rather than decorative.

Rhythm is built from repetition with variation: grids, contours, and parametric paths echo one another at different scales. The effect should feel like layered mathematical systems coexisting, where macro-structure remains legible even as micro-patterns become increasingly dense.

Typography is minimal and technical, functioning as a visual instrument instead of narrative text. Equations appear as artifacts of thought embedded in the scene, never dominating the canvas. The final image should read as painstakingly engineered visual research rather than a generic abstract wallpaper.

Craft quality is non-negotiable: edges are clean, transparency is intentional, and every element is tuned to support a coherent hierarchy. The finished work must look meticulously refined, as if produced through repeated expert passes with strict geometric discipline.
